    "If you are going to walk up a mountain, it is not enough to know the height of the mountain, you also want to know how steep the mountain is. Even if the mountain is very low, it can still be extremely difficult to reach the top if it is very steep. The steepness is how much the height is changing as a function of time (if we walk with the same pace) or how much the height is changing compared to our horizontal movement. To be more precise lets say we move from $x=a$ to $x=b$, and the height increases from $h_a$ to $h_b$, the steepness is"

    "If we climb a ladder, the horizontal movement is small ($x_b-x_a$ is small) and the increase in height is large, hence the steepness is large. If we walk a long a flat path we have no vertical movement and the steepness is zero ($h_a=h_b$). Mathematically, if we let $x_b$ and $x_a$ come infinitely close, the steepness is called a *gradient*, and we denote it by $\\nabla h(x)$. Note also that the sign of the gradient tells something about the direction. If we climb up a ladder, the height is increasing (positive gradient), on the other hand if we are climbing down the height is decreasing ($h_a>h_b$) and the gradient is negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the height of a mountain in two dimensions, $h=h(x,y)$, this is basically the contour lines on a map. The spacing between the contour lines is the gradient, if the spacing between contour lines are small the mountain side is steeper than if they are larger.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradients vs derivatives.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are only considering a single variable, height as a function of time or position, $x$, we often denote the gradient ($\\nabla h$), $h^\\prime(x)$ and call it the derivative of $h(x)$. In higher dimension, e.g. $h(x,y)$, we use the term partial derivatives, because there are now different variables we can vary e.g. latitude and altitude. The gradient is now a *vector*, $\\nabla=[\\partial h/\\partial x, \\partial h/\\partial y]$. $\\partial h/\\partial x$ is the partial derivative of $h(x,y)$ with respect to $x$, i.e. we keep $y$ constant and only differentiate with respect to $x$.\n",

    "\n",

    "Another example where gradients are important is the flow of heat. Heat flows from hot to cold places, the amount of heat is proportional to the temperature difference, i.e. a gradient in temperature. The flow of air is also from points of high pressure to low pressure, i.e. a gradient in pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    "A primary task of a modeler is to predict something. If there are no gradients in a system, nothing would happen and there is no reason to model anything. Hence, an extremely important task when we model something is to treat gradients carefully. If gradients are not represented correctly in a computer, the output of a simulation will introduce errors that sometimes can be so large that one cannot trust the simulation results.\n",

How can this be, how can information in a single point be used to predict the behavior of the function everywhere? One way of thinking about it could be to imagine an object moving in a constant gravitational field without air resistance. Newtons laws then tells us that  if we know the starting point e.g. ($x(0)$), the velocity ($v=dx/dt$), and the acceleration ($a=dv/dt=d^2x/dt^2$) in that point we can predict the trajectory of the object.

    "Hence, with a 4 bits word size, we can represent $2^4=16$ integers. The largest number is $2^4-1=15$, and the smallest is zero. What about negative numbers? If we still keep to a 4 bits word size, there are still $2^4=16$ numbers, but we distribute them differently. The common way to do it is to reserve the first bit to be a *sign* bit, a \"0\" is positive and \"1\" is negative, i.e. $(-1)^0 = 1$, and $(-1)^1=-1$. Replacing the first bit with a sign bit in equation ([19](#eq:taylor:bin4)), we get the following sequence of numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,-0,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7. The \"-0\", might seem strange but is used in the computer to extend the real number line $1/0=\\infty$, whereas $1/-0=-\\infty$. In general when there are $m$ bits, we have a total of $2^m$ numbers. If we include negative numbers, we can choose to have $2^{m-1}-1$, negative, and $2^{m-1}-1$ positive numbers, negative zero and positive zero, i.e. $2^{m-1}-1+2^{m-1}-1+1+1=2^m$.\n",
