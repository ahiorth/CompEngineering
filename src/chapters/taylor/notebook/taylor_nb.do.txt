======= Getting familiar with Taylors formula =======

Learning goals:
o Understand how Taylors formula can be used to approximate a function
o Understand approximation error

======= Plot $\sin x$ =======
Run the script below, and you will see a plot of $\sin x$ on the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$.
@@@CODE func_plot.py

Is this a good plot of $\sin x$? Improve the code above to produce a
better plot of $\sin x$.

o How many points are needed?
o Do we need an equal number of points in the whole domain?

======= Taylor Polynomial Approximation =======
There are many ways of representing a function, but perhaps one of the most widely used is Taylor polynomials. 
Taylor series are the basis for solving ordinary and differential equations, simply because it makes it possible to evaluate any function with a set
of limited operations: *addition, subtraction, and multiplication*. The Taylor polynomial, $P_n(x)$ of degree $n$ of a function $f(x)$ at the point $c$ is defined as:
!bnotice Taylor polynomial:
!bt
\begin{align}
 P_n(x) &= f(c)+f^\prime(c)(x-c)+\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+\cdots+\frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n\nonumber\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{f^{(n)}}{k!}(x-c)^k.\label{eq:taylor:taylori}
\end{align}
!et
!enotice
If the series is around the point $c=0$, the Taylor polynomial $P_n(x)$ is often called a Maclaurin polynomial, more examples can be found 
"here":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series". If the series converge (i.e. that the higher order terms approach zero), then we can represent the
function $f(x)$ with its corresponding Taylor series around the point $x=c$:
!bt
\begin{align}
 f(x) &= f(c)+f^\prime(c)(x-c)+\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+\cdots
=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}}{k!}(x-c)^k.\label{eq:taylor:taylor}
\end{align}
!et
======= Maclaurin series of $\sin x$ =======
Show that the Maclaurin series of $\sin x$ is:
!bt
\begin{align}
\sin x = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!}+\cdots=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}x^{2n+1}.
\label{sin}
!et
======= Calculating $\sin x$ up to a certain error  =======
The error term in Taylors formula, when we represent a function with a finite number of polynomial elements is given by:
!bt
\begin{align}
R_n(x)&=f(x)-P_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\eta)}{(n+1)!}(x-c)^{n+1}\nonumber\\
      &=\frac{1}{n!}\int_c^x(x-\tau)^{n}f^{(n+1)}(\tau)d\tau,\label{error}
\end{align}
!et 
for some $\eta$ in the domain $[x,c]$.

Write an implementation of $\sin x$, that calculates $\sin x$ up to a
certain accuracy, using the error formula in equation (ref{error}).
