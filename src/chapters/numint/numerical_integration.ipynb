    "From the example above we were able to estimate the number of steps needed to reach (at least) a certain precision. In many practical cases we do not deal with functions, but with data and it can be difficult to evaluate the derivative. We also saw from the example above that the algorithm gives a higher precision than what we asked for. How can we avoid doing too many iterations? A very simple solution to this question is to double the number of intervals until a desired accuracy is reached. The following analysis holds for both the trapezoid and midpoint method, because in both cases the error scale as $h^2$. Assume that we have evaluated the integral with a step size $h_1$, and denote the result by $I_1$. Then we know that the true integral is $I=I_1+c h_1^2$, where $c$ is a constant. If we now half the step size: $h_2=h_1/2$, then the true integral is $I=I_2+c h_2^2$. Taking the difference between $I_2$ and $I_1$ gives us an estimate for the error:\n",

    "I_2-I_1=I-c h_2^2-(I-ch_1^2)=3c h_2^2, \n",

    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "This might seem like we need to evaluate the integral twice as many times as needed. This is not the case, by choosing to exactly half the spacing we only need to evaluate for the values that lies halfway between the original points. We will demonstrate how to do this by using the trapezoidal rule, because it operates directly on the $x_k$ values and not the midpoint values. The trapezoidal rule is:\n",

    "Note that the Gaussian quadrature converges very fast. From $N=2$ to $N=3$ function evaluation we reduce the error (in this spefic case) from 6.5% to 0.1%. Our standard trapezoidal formula needs more than 20 function evaluations to achieve this. How can this be? If we use the standard Taylor formula for the function to be integrated, we know that for $N=2$ the Taylor formula must be integrated up to $x^3$, so the error term is proportional to $h^4f^{(4)}(\\xi)$ (where $\\xi$ is some x-value in $[a,b]$). $h$ is the step size, and we can replace it with $h\\sim (b-a)/N$, thus the error scale as $c_N/N^4$ (where $c_N$ is a constant). Following the same argument, we find for $N=3$ that the error term is $h^6f^{(6)}(\\xi)$ or that the error term scale as $c_N/N^6$. Each time we increase $N$ by a factor of one, the error term reduces by $N^2$. Thus if we evaluate the integral for $N=10$, increasing to $N=11$ will reduce the error by a factor of $11^2=121$. "
