    "By 0D models we mean models that are only dependent on one variable, usually time. These models are often called \"lumped parameter models\", because they ignore spatial dependency and the parameters in the model are adjusted to match experimental data. In many cases it is more important to predict how a system evolves in time, than the spatial dependency. A very recent example is the spread of infectious deceases, like Covid-19, where the evolution of total number of infected people might be the most important and not where the infection happens. \n",
