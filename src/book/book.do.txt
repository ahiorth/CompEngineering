__Summary.__
(Work in Progress) The purpose of this document is to explain how computers solve mathematical models.
Many of the most common numerical methods are presented, we show how to implement them in Python, and discuss their limitations.
The mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum. All the material is available at
"github":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering". For each of the chapters there is a Jupyter "notebook":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/pub/chapters". This makes it possible to run all the codes in this document.
We strongly recommend to install "the Anaconda Python distribution":"https://www.anaconda.com/". All documents have been prepared using "doconce":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/pub/chapters".
