    "Solving systems of equations are one of the most common tasks that we use computers for within modeling. A typical task is that we have a model that contains a set of unknown parameters which we want to determine. To determine these parameters we need to solve a set of equations. In many cases these equations are nonlinear, but often a nonlinear problem is solved\n",
    "*by linearize* the nonlinear equations, and thereby reducing it to a sequence of linear algebra problems. Thus the topic of solving linear systems of equations have been extensively studied, and sophisticated linear equation solving packages have been developed. Python uses functions from the [LAPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK) library. In this course we will only cover the theory behind numerical linear algebra superficially, and the main purpose is to shed some light on some of the challenges one might encounter solving linear systems. In particular it is important for you to understand when it is stated in the NumPy documentation that the standard linear solver: [`solve`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html) function uses *LU-decomposition* and *partial pivoting*. \n",
    "\n",
    "After covering some basics of numerical linear algebra, we will shift focus to nonlinear equations. Contrary to linear equations, you will most likely find that the functions available in various Python library will *not* cover your needs and in many cases fail to give you the correct solution. The reason for this is that the solution of a nonlinear equation is greatly dependent on the starting point, and a combination of various techniques must be used.  \n",

    "# Solving linear equations\n",
    "There are a number of excellent books covering this topic, see e.g. [[press2007;@trefethen1997;@stoer2013;@strang2019]](#press2007;@trefethen1997;@stoer2013;@strang2019).\n",
    "In most of the examples covered in this course we will encounter problems where we have a set of *linearly independent* equations and one equation for each unknown. For these type of problems there are a number of methods that can be used, and they will find a solution in a finite number of steps. If a solution cannot be found it is usually because the equations are not linearly independent, and our formulation of the physical problem is wrong.\n",

    "# Example: Linear regression\n",
    "In the previous section, we considered a system of $N$ equations and $N$ unknown ($x_0, x_1,\\ldots, x_N$). In general we might have more equations than unknowns or more unknowns than equations. An example of the former is linear regression, we might have many data points and we would like to fit a line through the points. How do you fit a single lines to more than two points that does not line on the same line? One way to do it is to minimize the distance from the line to the points, as illustrated in [figure](#fig:nlin:reg).\n",

Note that this difference can be negative or positive depending if the data point lies below or above the line. We can then take the absolute value of all the distances, and try to minimize them. When we minimize something we take the derivative of the expression and put it equal to zero.  As you might remember from Calculus it is extremely hard to work with the derivative of the absolute value, because it is discontinuous. A much better approach is to square each distance and sum them:"
