I enjoyed to see how we could use a model to analyze data, and extract knowledge. However, I think that the model is too simple to capture the complexity of how an infectious disease spreads. It would be very interesting to see how the model could be improved to capture more effects, like vaccination, social distancing, etc.\n",

Though I think the project went reasonably well, it is probably better if I start earlier next time. Being a former mathematics student, I really enjoyed learning about how the Corona virus can be modelled with differential equations. The project allowed also gave me appreciation for how difficult it can be to analyze real-world data; it would be exciting to continue in the future by gradually extending the complexity of the model to allow for more realism!\n",
