    "# Exercise 5: Extending the model\n",
    "From the last exercise you might have noticed that the $SI$ model works quite good when the disease spreads fast in a smaller area and in short time. However a clear weakness with the model is that we tune the number $S_0$ to the data. In reality $S_0$ should be the total population of a country, or at least the total number of people in a city where there is a large outbreak. In Wuhan there are 11 million people, and in Hubei there are 58.5 million people. Setting $S_0$ to 11 or 58.5 million would greatly exaggerate the number of infected people in our model. The problem is clearly the probability of infection $\\beta$. As measures are taken $\\beta$ should decrease as a function of time. To capture this behavior, the covid-infection rate\n",
