    "## Random number generators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are much to be said about random number generators. The MCM depends on a good random number generator, otherwise we cannot use the results from\n",
    "statistics to develop our algorithms. Below, we briefly summarize some important points that you should be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random number generators are generally of two types: *hardware random number generator* (HRNG) or *pseudo random number generator* (PRNG).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. HRNG uses a physical process to generate random numbers, this could atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, microscopic fluctuations, which is translated to an electrical signal. The electrical signal is converted to a digital number (1 or 0), by sampling the random signal random numbers can be generated. The HRNG are often named *true random number generators*, and their main use are in *cryptography*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PRNG uses a mathematical algorithm to generate an (apparent) random sequence. The algorithm uses an initial number, or a *seed*,  to start the sequence of random number. The sequence is deterministic, and it will generate the same sequence of numbers if the same seed is used. At some point the algorithm will reproduce itself, i.e. it will have certain period. For some seeds the period may be much shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Many of the PRNG are not considered to be cryptographically secure, because if a sufficiently long sequence of random numbers are generated from them, the rest of the sequence can be predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Python uses the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) algorithm to generate random numbers, and has a period of $2^{19937}−1\\simeq4.3\\cdot10^{6001}$. It is not considered to be cryptographically secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pythons `random.uniform` function, a random seed is chosen each time the code is run, but\n",
    "if we set e.g. `random.seed(2)`, the code will generate the same sequence of numbers each time it is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Encryption\n",
    "This section can be skipped as it is not relevant for development of\n",
    "the numerical algorithms, but it is a good place to explain the basic\n",
    "idea behind encryption of messages. A very simple, but not a very good\n",
    "encryption, is to replace all the letters in the alphabet with a\n",
    "number, e.g. A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. This is what is know as a\n",
    "*substitution cipher*, it does not need to be a number it could be a\n",
    "letter, a sequence of letters, letters and numbers etc. The receiver\n",
    "can solve the code by doing the reverse operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "weakness of this approach is that it can fairly easily be cracked, by\n",
    "the following approach: First we analyze the encrypted message and find the frequency of each of the symbols.\n",
    "Assume that we know that the message is written in English, then the\n",
    "frequency of symbols can be compared with the frequency of\n",
    "letters from a known English text (the most common is `E` (12$\\%$), then `T`\n",
    "(9$\\%$), etc.). We would then guess that the most occurring symbol\n",
    "probably is an `E` or `T`. When some of the letters are in place, we\n",
    "can compare with the frequency of words, and so on. By the help of\n",
    "computers this process can easily be automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A much better algorithm is *to not replace a letter with the same\n",
    "symbol*. To make it more clear, consider our simple example where A=1, B=2,\n",
    "C=3, $\\ldots$. If we know say that A=1 but we add a *random number*,\n",
    "then our code would be much harder to crack. Then the letter A\n",
    "could be several places in the message but represented as a complete different\n",
    "number. Thus we could not use the frequency of the various symbols to\n",
    "crack the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can the receiver decrypt the message? Obviously, it can be done if\n",
    "both the sender and receiver have the same sequence of random numbers (or the *key*).\n",
    "This can be achieved quite simple with random number generators, if we\n",
    "know the seed  used we can generate the same sequence of\n",
    "random numbers. If Alice where to send a message to Bob without Eve\n",
    "knowing what it is, Alice and Bob could agree to send a message that\n",
    "was scrambled using Pythons Mersenne-Twister algorithm with seed=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of this approach is of course that Eve could convince\n",
    "Alice or Bob to give her the seed or the key. Another possibility is\n",
    "that Eve could write a program that tested\n",
    "different random number generators and seeds to decipher the message.\n",
    "How to avoid this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that Alice and Bob each had their own\n",
    "hardware random generator. This generator generated random numbers that was truly\n",
    "random, and the sequence could not be guessed by any outsider. Alice\n",
    "do not want to share her key (sequence of random numbers) with Bob,\n",
    "and Bob would not share his key with Alice. How can they send a\n",
    "message without sharing the key? One possible way of doing it is as\n",
    "follows: Alice write a message and encrypt it with her key, she send\n",
    "the message to Bob. Bob then encrypt the message with his key, he\n",
    "sends it back to Alice. Alice then decrypt the message with her key\n",
    "and send it back to Bob. Now, Bob can decrypt it with his own key and\n",
    "read the message. The whole process can be visualized by thinking of\n",
    "the message as box with the message. Alice but her padlock on the box\n",
    "(keeps her key for her self), she sends the message to Bob. Bob locks\n",
    "the box with his padlock, now there are two padlocks on the box. He\n",
    "sends the box back to Alice, Alice unlocks her padlock with her key,\n",
    "and sends it back to Bob. The box now only has Bob's key, he can\n",
    "unlock the box and read the message. The important point is that the\n",
    "box was never unlocked throughout the transaction, and Alice and Bob\n",
    "never had to share the key with anyone. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Errors on Monte Carlo Integration and the Binomial Distribution\n",
    "How many rocks do we need to throw in order to reach a certain accuracy? To answer this question we need some results from statistics. Our problem of calculating the integral is closely related to the *binomial distribution*. When we throw a rock one of two things can happen i) the rock falls into the water, or ii) it falls outside the pond. If we denote the probability that the rock falls into the pond as $p$, then the probability that it falls outside the pond, $q$, has to be $q=1-p$.\n",
