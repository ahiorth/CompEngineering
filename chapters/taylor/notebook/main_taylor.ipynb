    "# Numerical Errors\n",
    "To simulate a physical system in a computer model, we usually have to make space and time discrete. In order to simulate e.g. a rocket flying into space we typically find the position of the rocket at a specific time $t$, and the computer model calculates the new position at a later time $t+h$. $h$ is a step size, and if we assume it is one minute, then we have discretized one hour into 60 discrete chunks of time. The challenge for any modeler is to know if 1 minute is too short or too long? If $h$ was one second instead of one minute, one hour would be split into 3600 pieces. The simulation time would go up, but would the *accuracy* of our calculation be any better? The goal of any numerical simulation is to keep the numerical error to an acceptable level. We will never get rid of it as you will see in this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most physical systems are described in terms of *differential equations*. A differential equation describe how a physical phenomenon evolves in space and time. The solution to a differential equation is a function of space and/or time. The function could describe the temperature evolution of the earth, it could be growth of cancer cells, the water pressure in an oil reservoir, the list is endless. If we can solve the model analytically, the answer is given in terms of a known function. Most of the models cannot be solved analytically, then we have to rely on computers to help us. The computer does not have any concept of continuous functions, a function is always evaluated at some specific points in space and/or time. \n",

    "To represent a function of space and/or time in a computer, the function needs to be discretized. When a function is discretized it leads to discretization errors.

    "When we divide space and time into finite pieces to represent them in a computer, a natural question to ask is how many pieces do we need.

Clearly, we want to use as few points as possible but still capture shape of the true function.  \n",

One way of thinking about it could be to imagine an object moving in a constant gravitational field without air resistance. Newtons laws then tells us that  if we know the starting point e.g. ($x(0)$), the velocity ($v=dx/dt$), and the acceleration ($a=dv/dt=d^2x/dt^2$) in that point we can predict the trajectory of the object.
